## Healight Story
My first idea and concept about the project were "Green Life and Green planet".
I realized it begins by having a **harmonic life, healthy soul and a healthy body.** So I started the project, building a platform; a guidance for becoming better :)
In the heart of every guidance is knowledge, so the first part is an encyclopedia. Other phases will be:
* Online intelligence Analyzation
* Content Correction Mechanism
* Store
* Blog
* ....

Subjects are like:
* Changing Lifestyle
* Diet Modification
* Simple and Herbal treatments for discomforts and illnesses
* Genetic Improvement
* About The Spiritual and others Worlds! :astonished: 
* etc ...

Also included by beliefs such as:
* No Animal and Plants killing :)
* Having a Green Planet
* etc ...

As I am used to designing and implementing everything modular, like this project. Others can use it for their own goals or project.
